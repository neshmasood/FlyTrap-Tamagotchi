Project name: FlyTrap-Tamagotchi

User Objective:

   1. User will buy a new fly trap plant and name it. User will click PLAY and begin the journey to help their fly trap plant grow from bud to ‘adult’ (as it ages). 
   2. For the plant to grow, it needs flies, sunshine and water. The amount of these resources consumed will change every three seconds and the user has to replenish.
   3. The display will show the status/level of each input (updated every three seconds). If the food input level is low (4 or less), the plant will ask to feed it. When food button is clicked, a fly will appear.
   4. If the water input level is low (4 or less), the plant will ask to water it. When water button is clicked, water drops will appear.
   5. If the sunshine input level is low (4 or less), the plant will ask to give it some energy. When sunshine button is clicked, sun will appear.
   6. User can only provide one of these resources at a time; which will be the challenge.
   7. Once the plant's health reaches 0%, it will wither, a message will appear and user will have the option to try again.
